# VSCodeConfig

## This is a copy of the theme that I use for VS Code

## Description

This theme is based entirely on the open source variant of Operator Mono Italic, with one or two colour changes thrown in to my personal preference.
Please give the original creator some love at [this link](https://github.com/open-source-ideas/open-source-ideas/issues/10)!


## How to install

If you want to have your VSCode look *exactly* like mine then feel free to clone or download this repository and copy-paste the settings.json into your VSCode settings file (be sure not to overwrite any of your own settings that you may want to keep!), and install the .ttf files for that slick monospace italic goodness.

The fonts are open source *as far as I know* but if I am wrong and you know that I am, please let me know and I will do what I have to to honour the creator(s).
